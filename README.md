# MLX exported to light theme HTML is converted to Dark using MATLAB.

[Dark HTML.](https://anuragpaul0.github.io/DarkMLXhtml/Dark.html)

[Light HTML.](https://anuragpaul0.github.io/DarkMLXhtml/Light.html)

## Usage

As an example, here is a basic test to ensure the integrity of the final file:
On matlab replace the address in input(top) as:
```
ad = '/MATLAB Drive/mlxfile.html' % file path of the file
```
Run all sections and a new file mlxfile-Dark.html should be created with the same content as in mlxfile.html.

### Content

* `Dark.mlx` contains the main program, constants and most functions that are used to do this job.
* `Dark.html` contains dark themed html, same as the dark themed matlab preference MLX.
* `Light.html` contains MLX exported to light theme HTML.
